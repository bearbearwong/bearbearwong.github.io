                            <p>
                              The web studio TOP1 was my first company, where I was developing
                              sites using CMS Joomla. Those days were very funny.
                              I had to maintain browsers which worked in different ways.
                              Maybe it's not necessary to say IE 6 was my favorite browser.
                              Also I made buttons with rounded corners via 4 pictures! That was fun.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              As a young developer I thought that I was good at it. But my code
                              sucked. For example, I didn't know about W3C standards or best
                              practices of development.
                              Maybe that happened because I didn't have experienced mentors and
                              no one could point out my mistakes.

                              My fears were confirmed when I was going through job interview. I realized I was a really green developer. But one day I met a great frontend developer Mikhail and he invited me to join his team as a junior developer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              I immediately plunged into another world in the first days. It was very difficult for me because I started to work among people who were more experienced than me. Mikhail was demanding, but a fair lead. He helped me but I couldn't prove myself because I felt self-doubt.

                              The web studio TOP1 was my first company, where I was developing
                              sites using CMS Joomla. Those days were very funny.
                              I had to maintain browsers which worked in different ways.
                              Maybe it's not necessary to say IE 6 was my favorite browser.
                              Also I made buttons with rounded corners via 4 pictures! That was fun.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              As a young developer I thought that I was good at it. But my code
                              sucked. For example, I didn't know about W3C standards or best
                              practices of development.
                              Maybe that happened because I didn't have experienced mentors and
                              no one could point out my mistakes.
